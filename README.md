Katagonite
==========

Katagonite is, in short, a mod that has spent literal years brewing in the works.

This mod was not intended to be anything big: what is essentially raw glass, and the sunlight streaming through it.

I was considering making Katagonite around the change from 1.7.10 to 1.8, which was essentially the point that the entire modding community took a long, hard look at how mods were made before because suddenly someone pulled the switch and changed the system.

If you're somewhat familiar with any of the Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind, Oblivion or Skyrim), you'll note that there is an armor type that is literally raw glass crystals embedded in metal and leather.  My question was: Could something like that work as a light-bearing crystal, much like how glass fiber carries light?

Come present day, I ask myself what else could be done with glass crystals, and am wondering the ramifications of some of the stuff in-game:

Iron: Why is all of the iron in-game always white, except the anvil? And how in the world does it become wrought iron, if all of the ingots and blocks are polished?

Obsidian: I personally have a piece of green obsidian that I keep at my desk at my current job, where I have jeweler's rouge for polishing it.  Obsidian is literally dense, darkened glass - shouldn't there be some answer to making other colors of natural obsidian?

Stack Sizes: Now here's a fun one: why does a stack of ingots make only 7 blocks with one awkward ingot to the side? Neither of those numbers make sense in a 64-item inventory - why not blocks of 8 ingots, instead?

---

Idle ramblings aside, I do not intend to change the entirety of Minecraft.  Rather, I hope to approach the modding scene with a long-pondered mod that looks good and works out for anyone using it.

If you would see some of my thoughts about the mod, "katagonite thoughts.txt" would be where you would want to look for some of my more in-depth thoughts about the mod.  Nothing is set in stone, except the poor chap in the concrete boots at the bottom of the lake.
